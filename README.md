# eia-webapp
 
eia-webapp is a streamlit web application that leverages the
US-EIA Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) bulk data that is consistently
updated.

Through the development of this web application, we look at time-series trends
and implement machine learning algorithms to forecast scenarios including the
effects of seasonality, amongst other factors.

## TODO:

- Begin adding columns to get a good home layout.
  - Identify what are the most important oil and gas plots.
    - Oil price, Gas price, Inventory (supply/demand).
    - Top operators if able to be found in bar chart?
- Convert figures to plotly.
- Add some additional metrics like 20 day MVA.
- Standard deviations.
- Box and whisker or other applied statistical techniques.
